PySpark
- addressed a large scale data analytics challenge
- performed log mining tasks on large log files
- performed movie recommendation with scalable collaborative filtering. 
- scalable k-means to analyse big data.
- created pipelines, cross-validators and a different range of supervised learning methods for large datasets
 

Folder 1:

Q1_code.py:
•	Performed data wrangling and log mining tasks on NASA access log dataset

Q2_code.py:
•	Created movie recommendation system by using scalable collaborative filtering technique and carried out user analysis by using scalable K-means

Folder 2:

Q1_code.py
•	Examined the training times (5/10 cores) and performance of supervising learning algorithms(Random Forrest, Gradient Boosting, and shallow Neural Networks) on a 2.6GB(zipped) data to identify HIGGS bosons 

Q2_code.py:
•	Created a tandem model consisting of a Binary Classifier(Linear Regression) and a Regression model(Gamma Regressor) to predict insurance payments
